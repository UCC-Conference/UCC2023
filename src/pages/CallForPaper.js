                    The digital transformation of all areas of life is accelerated in this decade by novel cloud services, e-infrastructures, data platforms and cyber-physical system integration. This broader scope of cloud computing calls for
                    technically sound contributions that combine scale with convenience and reliability. Society and economy depend on cloud applications delivering compute power on demand in every location along data paths as a general service to
                    the public, in analogy to conventional utilities. The engineering of such systems and applications calls for scientifically proven approaches, methods, tools and technologies.
